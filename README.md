# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-from-Scratch-on-IRIS
Implementation of Naive Bayes on Normal Distribution from Scratch using Iris Dataset.


## **I Implemented Naive Bayes by Following this steps:**

1. Import Important Python Libraries.
2. Created a Naive bayes class, contains important Functions of Naive(Fit function, CalculatStatistics to calculate mean and variance, Perior, prediction).
3. Loaded IRIS Dataset from SikitLearn.
4. Heat map of IRIS.
5. Split Data into Features and Targets.
6. Split Data into Training and Test.
7. Model Prediction and Evaluation.
